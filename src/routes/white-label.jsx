          <p><b>Utherverse is looking for Global white label licensee's to help us expand our operations on a world-wide basis</b>. For the purposes of this document, white labels will be referred to as “franchises”. <b>These are unconnected to our North American operations (Utherverse) at the moment and are developed locally in those countries using our software</b>. We are looking to find partners in Holland, Italy and other countries to bring up versions of our software in those specific languages and demographics. Eventually, we will be connecting all the franchises together once they are ready so that users can experience different parts of the world in the local languages. They would also be able to use the different virtual currencies in each of the countries. This is a long term plan (3-5 years) For now, we are looking for new franchise partners to operate the software locally in new countries. </p>
          <p><b>It is possible to look at franchise opportunities that have no direct connection to other platforms out there but this should be discussed separately</b>. A franchise should be brought online locally and unconnected at first, then once it has had time to grow and become profitable, it can be considered for connection to the rest of the network.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">About Utherverse</h2>
          <p><b>With the public launch of its groundbreaking technology, Utherverse has begun to revolutionize the way people relate to each other and the ways that they undertake their online experiences</b>.  The Utherverse delivers entirely new kinds of online social interactions, as well as vastly improved methods for business to engage and for users to experience entertainment, commerce, news and events.</p>
          <p>A franchise is simply a white label license to our software and can be developed as an entire virtual world or as something smaller such as a casino that can be licensed to a government for use in a similar fashion to British Columbia's BCLC located at <a href="https://playnow.com">playnow.com</a>.</p>
          <p>A virtual casino could comprise of slots, tables and even sports betting with sports being streamed live into the virtual world using either flash or windows media. This also provides the opportunity for entertainment to be broadcasted into the virtual world. The entertainment could consist of concerts, comedians or other forms of entertainment found in regular real world casinos around the world. There are many advantages in using our software in for that purpose such as keeping track of players, testing new game placements and measuring user flow within a live dynamic environment. This information can be used to increase revenues within the virtual world and then also transferred to real world environment as well.</p>
          <p>The software comes with a built in world currency that can be used for things like "cover charge" into shows and regions, merchandise sales, tipping and advertising for upcoming promotions. The world currency can be set to maintain a certain price point and then allowed to be withdrawn into real money where regulations allow it. The virtual casino could also operate with real money currency as well, if applicable in that jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>When looking for franchise operators, we look for someone local and established within those countries who wants to work on a project for long term growth and revenue. Someone who understands virtual worlds and the potential future opportunities. It also helps if that interested party already has a way of promoting through an existing user base in those countries. This could be through pre-existing websites or services operated that can immediately bring members into their branded virtual world.</p>
          <p>Having your own franchise gives you complete control over marketing, billing, world management, and the related support systems. We will design a limited amount of custom maps for your world so it has the look and feel of your country or brand. This is so that your customer base will have access to a "look and feel" that is familiar to them. For example, we have created Copacabana beach in the Brazilian franchise and Red Square for Russia.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">Social Center</h2>
          <p>The 2D web social center that comes with the virtual software license is a web 2.0 property that allows members to create profiles, post images, send messages, maintain a friends list and set clothing for their avatars. The social center comes with advertising spots that could be sold or used to promote events happening within the 3D virtual world. The social center also uses the world currency model and allows members to customize their account and avatar settings. </p>
          <p>The social center acts like a "home page" for users to access. This is where they can display information about themselves through pictures, bulletins, text and even color schemes. It also allows them to access features that they want activated such as the marketplace, a business profile, privacy settings, friends’ lists, our affiliate program, along with access to the world currency accounts.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">Administration</h2>
          <p><b>The software license also comes with an admin for the operator to use</b>. This allows them to manage customer support, world operations (moderation), the world currency and virtual world management. This software, currently in English is used by the staff who are operating the franchise.</p>
          <img src={whiteLabelAdmin} alt="Screenshot of the admin panel" />
          <p><b>There are many features built into the admin that can be used to "tweak" your virtual world</b>. The admin gives you overall statistics but also allows you to look up and track individual accounts if need be.  It provides such essential stats as unique/raw traffic, membership joins, sales downloads, trials, affiliate tracking and world population.</p>
          <p><b>The admin is web based and can be accessed from anywhere making it manageable and convenient</b>. You can also set different permissions for different users and control what level of access they have information to. For example, your customer support may need access to accounts and billing information while your world managers may only need access to region publishing and world management.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">World Expansion</h2>
          <p><b>Once a franchise has been launched and starts to grow in the amount of members, there are opportunities to expand. This can be done through a few different options:</b></p>
          <ol className="list-decimal">
            <li>Franchisee can contract Utherverse to build more maps and regions into the virtual world</li>
            <li>Franchisee can create maps themselves or through 3rd parties and have them imported for a fee</li>
          </ol>
          <p>*The easiest and fastest solution is for Utherverse to create the maps within the virtual world.</p>
          <p>We provide templates of virtual regions such as streets, stores, bars and offices in which users can add custom props and textures. This allows for millions of possible combinations of virtual worlds. These regions are then leased to the user for a weekly fee in world currency and gives the user control over the permissions in the region. They can choose who can enter, if there is a cover charge and what activities are allowed in their virtual world. This includes things like dancing, flying, roller skating, languages and presenter or entertainment roles.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">License Fee</h2>
          <ul className="checkbox">
            <li>

            <li>12 month exclusivity (from launch) for that country/demographic</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">Revenue Share</h2>
          <p>	We ask for <b>25% of all VIP Subscription revenue</b> (based on a recurring model that works in that country, Example $20 Euro per month)</p>
          <p><b>25% of all revenue earned through the web social center</b>. Example: www.utherverse.com from selling ads or cross promotions to affiliate programs</p>

          <p>All white label licenses must be assigned via a signed contract before any work is to begin. The contract should be negotiated in good faith and then signed. The initial deposit (if applicable) must also have arrived before Utherverse will commence work on a new project.</p>
          <h2 className="mb-6 pb-4 border-b">How Franchises Work</h2>
          <p>Franchises are mirrors of the Utherverse Social Network based in a different geographic location. Your Franchise will offer an immersive environment modeled after the location of your choice for your members to meet, chat and party with new people.</p>
